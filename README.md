Final Project Reflection – CS-330
Working through this project has helped me better understand how I approach both software design and development. When I design software, I try to break problems into smaller, manageable parts and build around a clear user experience. For this project, I focused on creating a visually compelling and interactive 2D animation that engaged users with real-time movement and input. I began with a basic working scene and then expanded it through iteration—adding collision logic, changing object states, and introducing user interaction one feature at a time.

Through this, I’ve developed stronger design skills like layout planning, visual feedback mechanics, and creating modular, readable code. I used a consistent structure to separate logic for rendering, movement, and collision detection, which not only made the code easier to maintain but also helped me troubleshoot more effectively. These tactics—modular functions, iterative testing, and focusing on clean visuals—are ones I can bring into any future software or game development work.

This project also deepened my appreciation for how computer science can help me reach my career goals. Learning how to control virtual environments, simulate physics, and implement real-time interactivity gave me both technical skills and creative confidence. Computational graphics and visualizations taught me how code can bring visual ideas to life—skills that are valuable whether I’m working on games, simulations, user interfaces, or data-driven apps in my future career.
